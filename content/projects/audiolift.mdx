**AudioLift** is a minimalist browser extension that lets you boost your volume beyond the default 100%. Perfect for quiet videos or low-power speakers.

### Why AudioLift?

Most volume boosters are bloated or track your browsing data. AudioLift is designed to be:
- **Fast:** Zero impact on page load times.
- **Private:** No tracking, no data collection.
- **Functional:** It does one thing and does it well.

### Technical Overview

Built with pure JavaScript using the Web Audio API, AudioLift creates a gain node and connects it to the source of the audio elements on the page.

#### Features
- **Volume Boost:** Increase volume levels up to 4x.
- **Toggle State:** Quickly enable or disable the boost.
- **Cross-browser:** Designed to work across Chromium-based browsers.
