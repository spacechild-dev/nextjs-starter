Security should never come at the cost of usability. **FlowOTP** is born from the need for a clean, efficient, and open-source way to manage TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) tokens.

### Why FlowOTP?

While many 2FA apps exist, many are cluttered with unnecessary features or are proprietary. FlowOTP focuses on:
- **Clean Architecture:** Built with TypeScript for maintainability and fewer bugs.
- **Privacy First:** Your keys stay on your device.
- **Minimalist Design:** A distraction-free interface for when you need your code fast.

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. TOTP Algorithm (RFC 6238)
At its core, FlowOTP implements the standard TOTP algorithm. This involves:
- **Secret Key Decoding:** Handling Base32 encoded secrets.
- **HMAC-SHA1 Hashing:** Generating a unique hash based on the secret and current time.
- **Dynamic Truncation:** Extracting a 6-digit code from the hash.

#### 2. Security Best Practices
- **In-Memory Security:** Ensuring sensitive keys are handled carefully in memory and wiped when not needed.
- **Input Validation:** Strict validation of secret keys to prevent common injection or formatting errors.

### Best Practices for 2FA Apps

- **Zero Analytics:** Security tools should not track user behavior. FlowOTP is strictly analytics-free.
- **Offline Capability:** A 2FA tool must work without an internet connection. All calculations in FlowOTP are performed locally.
- **Visual Feedback:** Clear timers showing code expiration help reduce user anxiety during login flows.

### Conclusion

FlowOTP is a testament to the fact that security tools can be both powerful and beautiful. By adhering to open standards and prioritizing user privacy, it provides a reliable alternative for modern digital security.
